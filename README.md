# The-Perfect-Guess
We are going to write a program that generates a random number and asks the user who guess it. If the player's guess is higher than the number the program displays "lower number please". Similarly if the user's guess too low, the program prints " higher number please". When the user guesses the correct number the program displays the number of guesses the player used to arrive at the number.
